Aim: To study and analyse the features of Bacillaria Paradoxa to create Digital simulations of the genus _Bacillaria_

Basic Introduction:   
Taking our Digital _Bacillaria_ project further, this year we aimed to add certain more functionalities in this project, our main aim is to develop on pre-existing work and add all the work in our newly developed library and web tool (Devolearn). Students need to work on pre-existing data of Bacillaria paradoxa (microscopy videos of bacillaria development), which will be provided during GSoC. The deliverables for this project will be to find features like size, position, and directional velocity so that a digital model can be built by using these parameters using few deep learning approaches like openCV, Deep Lab V3, and pytorch. Students will be provided with all the learning material required. Once this work is done, we also need to add this functionality to our devolearn library and web tool (the latter part will be done with help from mentors). Students are required to do some literature review to get on board with the project and tech stack required. It will be a great opportunity to learn and develop cool projects at the same time. Students need to document code properly. We are looking to create some easy to use colab/Azure/Jupyter notebooks for this project, so a wide variety of researchers can use our research project. 

Scope: It will be a first of its kind open source tool for researchers around the world to find parameters of Bacillaria through just a few commands and an online GUI. 

Level: Medium

Skills Required: python, C++, basics of Machine Learning libraries and computer vision, HTML, CSS.
