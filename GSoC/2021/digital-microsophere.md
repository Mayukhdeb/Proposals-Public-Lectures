## Digital Microsphere for Observing Neural Plate Development

To better understand the morphogenesis of the nervous system, it is necessary to develop novel techniques. This project will build upon the specialized microscopy techniques to develop a shell composed of projected microscopy images, arranged to represent the full external surface of a sphere. This will allow us to create an atlas of the embryo's outer surface, which in some species (e.g. Axolotl) enables us to have a novel perspective on neural development. The source data consists of nine images per sample from different points of view, which will be projected onto the surface of a virtual sphere. This will allow us to view the surface either continuously or in a montaged fashion. The student must be proficient in Computer Vision (C++, Python) and perhaps even Topological techniques, and it will be up to the student to propose a viable solution to this problem.
