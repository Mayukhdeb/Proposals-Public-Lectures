### GSoC Project: ImageJ Plug-in for Microscopy Image Processing  

**Description:**  The DevoWorm project is looking to build segmentation and digitization tools to extract information from microscopy imaging data. The project will focus on finding a way to extract data information about cellular structures and a cell's relative position within the embryo. The outcome would be open-source code for ImageJ plugins (Java) and applications run in Python. These tools will have particular relevance for identifying and parameterizing the precursors of neuronal cells within early-stage embryos.  


**Aims:**  The current plan is to develop plug-ins for ImageJ (Java) or scripts and other code to be run in a Python environment. This will require some research on the student's part. While the documentation exists for building applications in these two domains, our project does not currently have a library of existing software in this area. Our longer-term goal is to have a set of ready-made tools for extracting numeric data from high-resolution microscopy images and high-quality publication images. The student will work with the mentor to formulate the details of feature extraction and feature engineering, and then implement and benchmark these solutions on a number of secondary datasets.  


**Skills:** open source development experience with Java and Python, along with coursework in machine learning/pattern recognition/computer vision. An interest in the underlying biological processes is essential. Good communication skills and familiarity with open science practices are expected.
