**Ideas for Google Summer of Code:**

**1)** Morphozoic advancement: applying pattern formation to lineage trees, heterochrony, and spatial patterns.  

* check out [Tom's new paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/30/478750); he uses deep learning + behavioral primitives to produce/classify output.  

* can we use a dynamic lineage tree (aka a computationally-friendly pattern generating tree) as a means to constrain/classify morphozoic (nested CA) output?

**2)** second step in GSoC 2017: create masks for segmentation of microscopy images and movies using GSoC 2017 ImageJ plug-in as a base.  

**3)** second step in GSoC 2018: create a visualization skin for GSoC 2018 project. Focus on networks and 3-D modeling.  

**4)** Braitenberg vehicles and the developmental assembly of connectomes. Model the morphogenesis of a Braitenberg vehicle (sensors effectors, body), then provide wiring rules for the connectome. 

* connection matrix with cross-talk points.

* rules for symmetric and asymmetric laterality, formation of distributor rings or bifurcations at cross-talk points.

* correspondance between expansion of vehicle body and expansion of connectome.

* do we use a genetic representation?

**5)** Multicell systems: use current work on multicell systems to crete a generative program that will produce new phenotypes according to rules and evaluate each new phenotype using Euler path analysis.  

* further analysis by using a phylogenetic framework. Phenotypes that are not Euler complete form new clades with _n_+1 modules.
