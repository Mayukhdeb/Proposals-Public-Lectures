Ideas for Google Summer of Code:

1) Morphozoic advancement: applying pattern formation to lineage trees, heterochrony, and spatial patterns.  

2) second step in GSoC 2018: create a visualization skin for GSoC 2018 project. Focus on networks and 3-D modeling.  

3) second step in GSoC 2017: create masks for segmentation of microscopy images and movies using GSoC 2017 ImageJ plug-in as a base.  

4) Braitenberg vehicles and the developmental assembly of connectomes. Model the morphogenesis of a Braitenberg vehicle (sensors effectors, body), then provide wiring rules for the connectome. 

* connection matrix with cross-talk points.

* rules for symmetric and asymmetric laterality, formation of distributor rings or bifurcations at cross-talk points.

* correspondance between expansion of vehicle body and expansion of connectome.

* do we use a genetic representation?

5) Multicell systems: use current work on multicell systems to crete a generative program that will produce new phenotypes according to rules and evaluate each new phenotype using Euler path analysis. 

* further analysis by using a phylogenetic framework. Phenotypes that are not Euler complete form new clades with $n+1$ modules.
