## DevoWorm: developing the worm (and Ascidian, and graph, and digital embryo)

Ever wondered how a worm develops from an egg to an adult? The DevoWorm subproject is focused on understanding embryogenesis and other developmental processes in worms using a combination of simulation, the analysis of secondary data, and experimental methods. Through this combination of methods, we are contributing to models of how worms develop their adult function and structure (e.g. phenotypes). At the next OpenWorm Journal Club, Dr. Bradly Alicea will teach us about how the adult _C. elegans_ is born!

In this talk, we will discuss the latest developments in the DevoWorm subproject [1]. Having made great strides since our last report to the OpenWorm community [2], this project is now a multifaceted investigation into the mechanisms and dynamics of nematode development. DevoWorm encompasses the application of theoretical biology, innovations in data analysis, and development of simulation. We are interested in emulating _Caenorhabditis elegans_ embryogenesis, and development more generally. Advances include a software platform (Morphozoic) to model digital morphogenesis, computational and statistical analyses of secondary data (_C. elegans_ and _Ciona intestinalis_) to investigate developmental dynamics across species, and the generation and modeling of primary data to investigate reproductive and developmental plasticity. A number of results will be presented, including proof-of-concept pattern formation in Morphozoic, alternative representations to the standard lineage tree for cellular differentiation during embryogenesis [3, 4, 5], and the parameterization of reproduction and developmental plasticity in _C. elegans_.
