### Google Season of Documentation 2019 OpenWorm Idea  
The OpenWorm Foundation is a non-profit dedicated to creating the world’s first digital organism in an open science manner.  We have been operating since 2011, and over that time have had many documentation materials produced.  We are seeking a skilled technical writer to help us improve, refine, and amend our current documentation because after 8 years there needs to be a re-alignment of the documentation as it has gotten out of date!  Below is a more specific set of goals for what a technical writer would help with.  

a. Creating a new version of the http://docs.openworm.org site, currently hosted on Github here; which achieves the following improvements:

1. Acting as an “OpenWorm Wiki”, through making it very clear to all documentation readers they are welcome to submit pull requests to the GitHub-based markdown file that the documentation is written on.  

2. Refocus docs.openworm.org around OpenWorm simulation stack; initial documentation found here.  

3. Refocus docs.openworm.org around helping new volunteers run existing code and improve it.   

* Find and write specs for “casual contributor-friendly” contributions.  

4. Reference special topics.  

* Papers in a special issue journal that describe an overview of OpenWorm and subprojects within OpenWorm.  

* Educational materials such as OpenWorm badges.  

* Mathematical overview of OpenWorm: help refine a reference document started by Senior Contributor Gopal Sarma.  

5. Additional topics TBD.  

6. An inventory of projects and docs that align with current organizational goals.  

7. A reorganization of all project docs, mainly merging or tightly integrating DevoWorm, NeuroML, Geppetto, and other assorted docs into one location.  

b. If time allows, these are additional topics to address:  

c. Website redesign so as to make it easy to find key information (e.g. people, how to get to Slack, Github, Docker and Blender models).      
d. Help with the educational curriculum (OW-DW educational curriculum, digital badges).
