## Materials for Google Season of Docs (GSoD).  

### GSoD Announcement for 2019  [link](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline)

Potential Ideas:
1) Wiki for OW, including special topics and subprojects.

2) website refactoring --> make it easy to find key information (people, how to get to Slack, Github, Docker and Blender models).

3) help put together document started by Gopal: https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1IVxOWbdr6m8HUVNYeR8L--Bju84s5Mi6itbGmNsy3_A/edit?disco=AAAACkP-6GE&ts=5c5dc4b6&usp=comment_email_document&usp_dm=false

4) inventory of projects and docs -- do they align with current goals?

5) reorganization of all project docs --> merge DevoWorm, NeuroML, Geppetto, and other docs into one location.

6) help with educational curriculum.

7) find and write specs for "casual contributor-friendly" contributions.
