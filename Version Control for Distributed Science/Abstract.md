This presentation provides a highly-simplified (step-by-step) overview of version control in Github, Gitlab, and the Open Science Framework for use in the practice of open and distributed science. This was created for the [Reproducibility for Everyone](https://orthogonal-research-lab.github.io/reproducibility-website/) initiative and used both here and in the eLife Ambassadors' program.
